# FRC Strategy Planner - v2.4.8 ALPHA
FRC Strategy Planner is a cross-platform web application that will allow FRC users to easily develop strategies and draw on the FRC field.

# (1/4/2017) Started cleanup process for app release.

# (1/3/2017) Updated project to Ionic v2.0.0-rc.4
- Will break any version below v2.0.0, as several functions from Ionic are deprecated/removed.
- This was mainly to improve VirtualScroll performance. (We display a lot of data!) 

# (12/20/2016) This branch was successfully merged from 'ionic-dev'
- This means that FRCSP is now written with the Ionic v2 framework!
