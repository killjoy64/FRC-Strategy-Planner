# FRC Strategy Planner - v1.8.1 ALPHA
FRC Strategy Planner is a cross-platform web application that will allow FRC users to easily develop strategies and draw on the FRC field.

# (12/20/2016) This branch was successfully merged from 'ionic-dev'
- This means that FRCSP is now written with the Ionic v2 framework!
